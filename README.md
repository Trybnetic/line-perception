Currently, this repository contains the plans for an experiment about the perception of nonlinear lines. It is planned to extend the content of this
repository by the code to run the experiment, the collected data and the
analysis script as well as a preprint of the resulting report.

By now, the general idea and the planned procedure are described in
`preregistration/report/`. Feel free to have a look at the idea!
